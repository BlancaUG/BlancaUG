# MetroNyan

This project consists of designing a Telegram bot, which will guide the users
of said application to the restaurant they decide. The restaurants will be
chosen between all the possible ones located in Barcelona, based on the users requirements. The bot will also guide the users to the chosen restaurant through the shortest path, combining metro and walking displacements.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

In order to install the needed packages for this project, the ```pip3``` command (to install)
and the ```.zip``` (containing the files and codes) are needed.


### Installing

From the ```.zip``` the following needed files will appear:
- ```barcelona.grf```, the graph with Barcelona's streets
- ```restaurants.csv```,```restaestacions.csv```,```accessos.csv```, that are the data files that contain the information about thes restaurants, stations and accesses respectively.
- ```restaurants.py```, the module that reads the restaurant's data and searchs it.
- ```metro.py```, the module that builds the metro graph from the stations and accesses information.
- ```city.py```, the module that builds and consults the Barcelona's city graph.
- ```bot.py```, the module that through a telegram bot, it helps users choose a restaurant and leads them to it.
- ```requirements.txt```, with the needed installation libraries.
- ```README.md```
- ```*.png```, with the attached images of the documentation.

in order to install the libraries contained in ```requirements.txt```, the following command is needed:
```python3
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 It is important to know that this command has to be executed in the same directory where the ```requirements.txt``` is saven, and it installs in the system the packages annoted in this file.
 
 EXCEPTION: the ```osmnx```library is not included inside this file, because it has different ways to install it, depending on your operating system (it sometimes causes problems). You can install it as follows:
 - ```$ pip3 install osmnx```, if no error is shown this is the easiest and typical way to install it.
 - if the above command did not work, you can try to install it with conda, with
 ```python3
 $ conda config --prepend channels conda-forge
 $ conda create -n ox --strict-channel-priority osmnx
```
- you may also try to install an extra library, with ```$ brew install spatialindex```for Mac users or ```$ apt install libspatialindex-dev``` for Ubuntu.
 It is also important to remark that some of the imported libraries in the codes depend on the python version that is used. This is the case of ```TypeAlias```. We have imported it from ```typing_extensions```, but this is only accepted with python versions 3.9 or older. With posterior verisons, the import should be from ```typing```.
 
## Restaurants.py:
The principal functions from this module are the following ones:
- ```def read()```, that reads the data from the ```restaurants.csv``` and saves the remarkable one in its respective Restaurant attributes. It returns the posterior created restaurants list.
- ```def find(query : str, restaurants : Restaurants)```, that searches the restaurants that contain the specified query from the whole list. It follows a multiple and fuzzysearch at once, because it allows the user to search more than one word at a time and all of them have to appear in the attributes, but it also allows to search similar texts in case that the searched parameter and the found one differ from one error.

### running the tests:
there are some tests that can be done in order to understand the full application of this module, and getting familiar with it:
Examples: you need to modify the ```main```function in order to execute the tests
- to check if the ```read``` function runs correctly, you can try
```python3
def main():
    restaurants: Restaurants = read()  #contains all the bcn restaurants
    for restaurant in restaurants:
        print(restaurant.name)
        print(restaurant.addresses_district_name)
        print("--------")
```
like this you can compare with the ```.csv``` file and test if the information matches with the one obtained (the restaurant's name and district). Yo can access to any restaurant attribute if you want to.

- to check if the ```find``` fucntion works properly, you can try
```python3
def main():
    restaurants: Restaurants = read()  #contains all the bcn restaurants
    found: Restaurants = find ("retaurant buger example", restaurants)  #contains the burger restaurants located in "l'Eixample", althought the serached parameters are writed incorrectly.
    for restaurant in found:
        print(restaurant.name)  #it should return restaurants related with burgers
        print(restaurant.addresses_district_name)  # it chould return "Eixample"
        print("--------")
```
You can execute this "find" command with any parameters of your interest, but you have to take into an account that some errors can be made due to the fact that the fuzzysearch also looks for near matches from the word, and sometimes this leads to restaurants that do not have the searched parameter but some similar and unrelated one. 


## Metro.py:
This module consists on the following main functions:
- ```def read_stations()```, that reads the stations from the ```estacions.csv``` and saves the important information in the station's attributes.
- ```def read_accesses()```, that reads the accesses from the ```accessos.csv``` and saves the important information in the accesses attributes.
- ```def get_point(str)```, that is an auxiliar function for the previous read ones, and gets the coordinates points in a tuple format from the attribute "geometry".
- ```def get_metro_graph()```, which creates the metro graph, using some auxiliar functions to create the nodes (stations and accesses) and to create the edges (links, accesses and sections of traintrack).
- ```def show(g: MetroGraph)```, that shows interactively the respective graph.
- ```def plot(g: MetroGraph, filename: str)```, that saves in the given file the metro graph with the city map background.

### running the tests:
The following tests may also help you to check the functionality of this module. You should modify the ```main``` function with the folowing possible applications:
- to check the ```read_stations```, do as follows:
```python3
def main():
    stations: Stations = read_stations()  # reads the stations
    for stat in stations:
        print(stat.NOM_ESTACIO)
        print(stat.GEOMETRY[0])  # prints the station 'x' coordinate
        print("--------")
 ```
 This will print the stations names, which you can compare with the ones given in the ```.csv```file, and also prints the 'x' coordinate from the station, proving also the effectivity of the function ```get_point```, because of the separation between the coordinates of every station.

- in order to prove the ```read_accesse```, we will procede in the same way:
```python3
def main():
    accesses: Accesses = read_accesses()  # reads the accesses
    for acc in accesses:
        print(acc.NOM_ACCES)
        print(acc.GEOMETRY[1])  #prints the access 'y' coordinate
        print("--------")
 ```
That in this case prints the access name and its 'y' coordinate, proving that the ```get_point``` is also effective in the accesses case.

- To test the ```get_metro_graph()```, it is possible to make prints in the respective auxiliary functions in order to see if the nodes and edges are correctly added, but instead it is easier and more visual to execute directly the ```show```and ```plot```functions, because the graph is totally refelected there. So you could make:
```python3
def main():
    metro = get_metro_graph()  # builds the metro graph
    show(metro)  # shows interactively the graph
    plot(metro, 'plot_metro.png')  # saves the graph in the file 'plot_metro.png'
```
This will show the graph interactively in an independent window, and after you close that window, the execution will finish and the graph will be saven in the given file.
