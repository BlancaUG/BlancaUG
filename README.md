# MetroNyam

This project consists of designing a Telegram bot, which will guide the users
of said application to the restaurant they decide. The restaurants will be
chosen between all the possible ones located in Barcelona, based on the users requirements. The bot will also guide the users to the chosen restaurant through the shortest path, combining metro and walking displacements.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

In order to install the needed packages for this project, the ```pip3``` command
and the ```requirements.txt``` are needed.


### Installing

From the ```.zip``` the following needed files will appear:
- ```barcelona.grf```, the graph with Barcelona's streets
- ```restaurants.csv```,```restaestacions.csv```,```accessos.csv```, that are the data files that contain the information about thes restaurants, stations and accesses respectively.
- ```restaurants.py```, the module that reads the restaurant's data and searchs it.
- ```metro.py```, the module that builds the metro graph from the stations and accesses information.
- ```city.py```, the module that builds and consults the Barcelona's city graph.
- ```bot.py```, the module that through a telegram bot, it helps users choose a restaurant and leads them to it.
- ```requirements.txt```, with the needed installation libraries.
- ```README.md```
- ```*.png```, with the attached images of the documentation.

in order to install the libraries contained in ```requirements.txt```, the following command is needed:
```python3
 #> pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 It is important to know that this command has to be executed in the same directory where the ```requirements.txt``` is saven, and it installs in the system or in the activated virtualenv the packages annoted in this file.
